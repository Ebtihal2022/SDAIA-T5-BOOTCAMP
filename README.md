# PROJACT NAME 
# Diabetes-Prediction 

Predicting diabetes from medical records using machine learning. 
Diabetes is considered as one of the serious health issues which cause an increase in blood sugar. Many complications occur if diabetes remain untreated unidentified.

# Facts:
* In 2019, approximately 463 million adults were living with diabetes; by 2030 this will rise to 578 million.
* 1 in 2 adults with diabetes go undiagnosed (232 million people).
* 1 in 5 diabetics (136 million people) are over 65 years old.

# The aim here is to build a model to detect and predict diabetes.

# Abstract:-  
Diabetes is an illness caused because of high glucose levels in the human body. Diabetes should not be ignored if it is untreated then Diabetes may cause some major issues in a person like heart-related problems, kidney problems, blood pressure, eye damage and it can also affect other organs of the human body. Diabetes can be controlled if it is predicted earlier. To achieve this goal this project work we will do early prediction of Diabetes in a human body or a patient for higher accuracy through applying, Various Machine Learning Techniques. Machine learning techniques Provide better results for prediction by constructing models from datasets collected from patients. In this work, we will use Machine Learning Classification and ensemble techniques on a dataset to predict diabetes.

### Which are  
* K-Nearest Neighbour (KNN).
* Logistic Regression (LR)
* Decision Tree (DT).
* Support Vector Machine (SVM).
* Gradient Boosting (GB).
* Random Forest (RF).

The accuracy is different for every model when compared to other models. The Project work gives the accurate or higher accuracy model  hows that the model is capable of predicting diabetes effectively. Our Result shows that Random Forest achieved higher accuracy compared to other machine learning techniques.
